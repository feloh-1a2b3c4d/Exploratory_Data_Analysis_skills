Performing EDA on World happiness, Nobel prizes and heart diseases datasets.

# General
I did exploratory data analysis by first importing the CSV file using pandas to load and understand the dataset. Then handled missing values by identifying null entries and further removing them to maintain data consistency. Morever, dropped unnecessary columns that were not useful for analysis and create new columns from existing data to extract meaningful information. Merging datasets then employing groupby function to aggregate data based on specific categories and calculate summary statistics such as averages and counts. Finally, created new functions to perform custom calculations and apply transformations across the dataset, which helped in gaining clearer insights.
